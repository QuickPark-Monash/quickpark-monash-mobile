<h1>QuickPark Website Viewing Info</h1>
Welcome, to start off, we are currently hosting the webpage on GitHub Pages, here https://quickpark-monash.github.io/quickpark-monash-mobile/ Before you navigate the website, we need you to do some adjustments to your desktop internet browser. If you are currently on your mobile phone, please skip to <a href="https://github.com/QuickPark-Monash/quickpark-monash-mobile#viewing-on-your-mobile-device">this section</a>.

<h3>Viewing on your desktop internet browser</h3> 
<h4>Step 1: Opening Google Chrome Developer Tools</h4>

<h4>Step 2: Changing your device size</h4>
Now, on the top left corner, you should see a <code>tablet and phone icon</code>. Clicking this icon will allow you to change the size of your screen as if you were viewing the website on that particular device. When <code>toggled</code>, you should see the icon glow in blue like so. Your screen will shrink, but that shouldn't stop you from continue reading.<br>

<h4>Step 3: Adjusting the correct phone model</h4>
The webpage built is currently adjusted to look good on <b>most *cough*</b> of the mobile devices in the selection option. It started off with the <code>iPhone X model</code>, but was soon responsive enough to handle different <code>android and iPhone models</code> as well. You should see something like so. Then, you can click on the dropdown menu right by the phone model to change it. Make sure to set it to <code>iPhone X</code>.<br>
