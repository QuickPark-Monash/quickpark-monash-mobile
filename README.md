<h1>QuickPark Repo Instructions</h1>
Welcome, to start off, we are currently hosting the webpage on GitHub Pages. Before we give you the link, we need you to do some adjustments to your desktop internet browser. If you are currently on your mobile phone, please skip to this section. 

<h3>Viewing on your desktop internet browser</h3> 
<h4>Step 1: Opening Google Chrome Developer Tools</h4>
Press <code>Option + âŒ˜ + J</code> on Mac products, or <code>Shift + CTRL + J</code> on Windows to open up the Google Chrome <code>Developer Tools</code>. You should see something like below.

<h4>Step 2: Changing your device size</h4>
Now, on the top left corner, you should see a tablet and phone icon. Clicking this icon will allow you to change the size of your screen as if you were viewing the website on that particular device. When toggled, you should see the icon glow in blue like so. Your screen my shrink, but that shouldn't stop you from continue reading.

<h4>Step 3: Adjusting the correct phone model</h4>
The webpage built is currently adjusted to look good on <b>most *cough*</b> of the mobile devices in the selection option. It started off with the IphoneX model, but was soon responsive enough to handle different android and Iphone models as well. You should see something like so.
